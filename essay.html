    <h1 class="name">The Past</h1>
    <p>My mom once told me a story about how on my first birthday she did a Chinese tradition on me that involves putting me in the center of a circle consisting of different items such as a basketball, art supplies, tools, etc. that is meant to be used to predict a child’s future hobbies or interests; and as a baby I immediately went for the art supplies and the rest is history. I’ve been doing art for as long as I could pick up a pencil, spending the majority of my life trying to find creative ways to express myself from drawing and painting to writing poems and raps.</p>
        <p>My intention when I first decided to come to Purchase College was to major in Graphic Design, but I never ended up finishing my portfolio, so instead I decided to major in Arts Management with the intention of being able to learn about the business side of the art world. In my second semester of Freshman year I took the course Design Principles as at this point I had not given up my interest in Graphic Design, and I just instantly fell in love, literally that same semester I was changing my major to New Media. In the end I think it was meant to be because I much prefer New Media to Graphic Design, because in Graphic Design from the beginning you are set within a specific type of digital design with little leeway, but in New Media you get a chance to try pretty much everything and then create your own focus from there, which is perfect for someone like me who doesn’t know exactly what he wants and yet wants to try everything. For my Design Principles class I was able to explore a level of creativity with my projects that I had never experienced in my high school years which I soon realized is constant with pretty much all the studio classes within this major. You’re essentially given a prompt, some pretty loose parameters and then you’re sent off, which was very new to me, but still very welcomed. One project of note that I did in this course was ‘Word. Meaning. Play.’ where the prompt was you had to choose words and find a way to express their meanings visually through spacing, size, color, etc. this project was intriguing to me because it forced me to think about basic words like crash and slice and fall in a very visual way and then I had to take that a step further and actually display that.</p>
        <p>In my next semester as a sophomore I was now a full-fledged New Media major and I took Introduction to Sound and Programming for Visual Artists. In Intro to Sound I was going in with absolutely no knowledge of sound production or anything like that and yet I found this class extremely interesting and enjoyable. There was even more freedom in this class than there was in my Design Principles course, in this class we’d cover certain sound production techniques and then we’d be instructed to just create pretty much anything in Audacity using these techniques. I was able to embody my love of music in this class and create various beats using so many different sound clips that I’d recorded on my own. Programming for Visual Artists was undoubtedly my favorite studio class by far, it made me develop an entirely new love for coding. For my final I created a game using the Processing we had been learning that I ended up being immensely proud of, to the point where it made me strongly considered going into a career focused on coding if not just game design itself.</p>
        <p>In my second semester of sophomore year I took Intro to Digital Photography and Video Art 1 both courses focusing on subjects I had very little past experience with, and I also took Art and Technology which taught me about the relationship between modern forms of art and technology throughout time. For both Intro to Digital Photography and Video Art 1 it was a very new experience for me handling professional camera equipment and learning how to handle and use them.  In Intro to Digital Photography we learned some photo manipulation that allowed me to enhance the photos I took and also manipulate them turning them into something much more creative and expressive. 
        This semester I am taking Intro to Web and although I did go into this course knowing HTML and CSS from teaching myself in the past I am still learning a lot as well as thoroughly enjoying the experience, despite the fact that it is all online during this current pandemic. All in all I couldn’t be happier in this current major and I am grateful for all the experience I went through in order to get me to this point in my academic career.

        <h1 class="name">The Future</h1>
        <p>As I mentioned before I just fell in love with coding through my programming class and I also love the Intro to Web class I’m currently taking, so for my future in the New Media program I want to focus on coding and furthering my knowledge of programming as well as increasing the number of programming languages I know. I genuinely believe that coding will be a very large part of the future of art and technology and I want to prepare myself for that.</p>
            <p>One class I’m very interested in taking is New Directions in Virtual Space the idea of game design isn’t something I really even considered before taking Programming for Visual Artists, but now I’m very interested in the idea of creating a form of 2 or 3 dimensional art that you’re able to take the next level by controlling it and having it interact with things around it. I am also interested in the introduction of the programming language C# and the different ways I would be able to apply it outside of game design as well as what it is capable of doing within game designing. </p>
        <p>Another course I want to take is Scripting for the Web in order to further develop the skills that I am currently learning in my Intro to Web class. I believe that coding for web development is slowly becoming less prevalent and necessary because of the continuous advancement of web creation software like Webflow, Adobe Spark, Wordpress, etc. that don’t require you to actually know any coding to make a professional looking webpage, but nonetheless I’m really interested in learning more and more about web development. Then aside from just creating the website this class also says that it teaches “use of cookies, localStorage, video/audio, geolocation, an application program interface such as the Google Maps API, responsive design, and accessibility” which goes beyond just the coding which I think is very useful to learn when it comes to web development. </p>
            <p>When it comes to internships and Senior project honestly I haven’t thought too much about these things even though I know it’s about time to start considering them, but I wanted to become more certain on what I wanted to focus on for the rest of my time in the New Media program before I started thinking about those things. Now that I am pretty confident about what I want to focus on I know that I can now start seriously considering where I want to intern and what I want to work on in my Senior year. 
            I am extremely excited for all the things that I have the possibility to learn and create within the New Media program. I already know that there are so many additional paths that I would be able to take from here and just thinking about that gives me hope for a creative and expressive future.
