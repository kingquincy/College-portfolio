# About my College Portfolio project
In college, my field of study was a program called 'New Media', the idea of this program was to give you an introduction to various forms of digital media, including photography, graphic design, programming, web design, video editing, etc., then after you finish the introductory courses and get a good idea of all the different mediums within 'New Media', you are expected to choose a path that you want to follow, create a site that showcases some of the work you've done throughout your introductory courses, and make your case for following down that path and what you hope to gain from it. I went down the path of web development, at the time it was more broad and was more just 'programming' as a whole and all the things encompassed within that. I showcased some projects from learning about graphic design, sound mixing, video, and photo editing. In the end, I, along with one other person, won a grant for the design of our sites and the content within it.
