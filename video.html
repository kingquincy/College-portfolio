    <p>For this Video Art 1 assignment the prompt was based around our bodies and perfoming in front of the camera and
        how these videos that we were creating conditioned the way we viewed ourselves. Our 'presence' was meant to be
        the central subject of the video. So for me I wanted to create a video that was able to embody an aspect of
        myself, that aspect being my creative side. So I decided to do this by writing a poem/rap for this project, but
        then I needed someway of presenting my body in front of the camera. I decided to keep my actions simple in order
        to contrast the larger themes that I was discussing in what I wrote. </p>
