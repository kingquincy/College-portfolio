    <p>For my Intro to Sound midterm I wanted to use common sounds that I found around me, like microwave beeps, paper
        ripping, drawers opening and closing, etc., and use them to create a beat. While that was my main premise, I
        wanted to take that a step further and add a narrative. I used recordings of quotes from movies and TV shows
        and put them together in order to create a 'story'. In this story the voices are convincing me to make my beat
        more complex until they're satisfied.</p>

    <p>For my Intro to Sound final I wanted to take a step back and focus on one thing in order to really put all my
        effort into it. For this project I took the idea of using common sounds to create a beat and took that to the
        next level. I recreated the song Eye of the Tiger by Survivor using <strong>only</strong> my own recorded
        sounds, including finger tapping, drawer closing, microwave beeps, paper crumbling, etc. and then I changed each individual recording's speed, tone, volume and length to match the sounds in the actual song and repeated them when necessary and then put it all together for this DIY version of the well known classic Eye of the Tiger.</p>
